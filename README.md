# Projet2A
Projet de deuxième année aux Mines de Nancy - Second year project in the engineering school "Ecole des Mines de nancy"

This code is an implementation of several methods and algorithms in order to maximize the average "temperature" in a room. By "temperature"  we mean a function that is a solution of the heat equation on a surface. In our case, the surface is a polygon of fixed area.

The overall project was to find the optimal polygonal shape for a given area.
